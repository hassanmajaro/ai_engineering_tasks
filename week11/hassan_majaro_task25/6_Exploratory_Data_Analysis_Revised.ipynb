    "## 0. Executive summary \n",
    "\n",
    "The red-wine quality dataset shows that class of quality is imbalanced, **quality is driven by higher alcohol and balanced acidity** (low volatile acidity + moderate fixed/citric acid), with supporting contributions from sulphates and density. Use **classification** models (multiclass), engineer **acidity-ratio** and **interaction** features, scale/transform skewed variables, treat outliers, and prefer tree-based classifiers for production-ready performance — all decisions below are tied to the EDA evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Univariate findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding (evidence)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Several variables are **right-skewed** (you observed residual sugar, total SO₂, chlorides skewed in histograms & boxplots).\n",
    "* Outliers present for sulfur-related and acidity measures in boxplots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations & rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Log-transform skewed variables** (e.g., `residual sugar`, `total sulfur dioxide`, `chlorides`).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Skewness → asymmetric influence on distance/linear models and unstable variance. Your EDA showed these variables are right-skewed; log(1+x) reduces influence of extremes and makes distributions more Gaussian-like.\n",
    "   * *Action:* `df['residual sugar_log'] = np.log1p(df['residual sugar'])` etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Outlier handling (Winsorize or IQR-capping) for extreme acidity/sulphates**.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Violin/boxplots show extreme tails. Outliers can distort many algorithms (especially KNN, SVM, linear models).\n",
    "   * *Action:* Cap values at `Q1 - 1.5*IQR` and `Q3 + 1.5*IQR`, or Winsorize the top/bottom 1–2%.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Scaling**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Features have different ranges (alcohol ~10–12, pH ~3.x, SO₂ up to dozens). For distance-based or regularized models, scale features.\n",
    "   * *Action:* Use `StandardScaler` for models like Logistic/SVM; `RobustScaler` if outliers remain; tree models do not require scaling but scaled engineered features help interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Target handling: classification labels**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* `quality` is discrete (3–8). It has already been mapped to categories (Low/Medium/High). Use classification pipeline.\n",
    "   * *Action:* For multiclass classification, either use the integer labels (3–8) with multiclass classifier or use grouped labels (`Low/Medium/High`)  coarser prediction is prefered.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Bivariate findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key EDA evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlation**: `alcohol +0.48`, `volatile acidity −0.39`, `sulphates +0.25`, `citric acid +0.23`.\n",
    "* **Visuals**: Box/violin plots showed medians shift with quality (alcohol medians increase; volatile acidity medians decrease).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations & rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep high-signal features**: `alcohol`, `volatile acidity`, `sulphates`, `citric acid`, `density`, `chlorides`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Ranked by correlation and supported by grouped means and visual separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Evaluate and drop/ deprioritize low-signal features**: `residual sugar`, `free sulfur dioxide` (very low correlations ~0.01, −0.05).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Low linear relationship  may add noise or overfit. Keep them only if domain knowledge says otherwise, or if new features involving them show predictive gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check multicollinearity** (VIF) among acidity measures and pH.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* `fixed acidity` and `pH` are chemically related; using them raw together can inflate VIF. If VIF > 5–10, consider replacing with ratios (see next section).\n",
    "   * *Action:* Compute VIF and respond accordingly; if high, replace with engineered acidity ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Trivariate & grouped multivariate findings \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core evidence\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interaction pattern:** high `alcohol` + low `volatile acidity`  highest quality (grouped means & trivariate visuals).\n",
    "* **Group means:** `alcohol` increased ~9.96 --> 12.09 from quality 3 --> 8; `volatile acidity` decreased ~0.88 --> 0.42.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature engineering recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Acidity ratio: `fixed_to_volatile = fixed_acidity / volatile_acidity`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Grouped means and violin plots show that quality improves when stable acids (fixed) dominate over volatile (harsh) acids. The ratio captures that balance better than either feature alone.\n",
    "   * *Action:* `df['FA_to_VA_ratio'] = df['fixed acidity'] / (df['volatile acidity'] + eps)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Citric balance: `citric_over_total_acid = citric_acid / (fixed_acidity + volatile_acidity + eps)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Citric acid adds freshness — EDA showed citric acid rises with quality. Normalizing by total acid captures relative freshness.\n",
    "   * *Action:* create ratio; `eps` small constant to avoid divide-by-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alcohol–Acidity interaction: `alcohol_acid_inter = alcohol * (1/ (volatile_acidity + eps))` or `alcohol / volatile_acidity`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Trivariate analysis showed high alcohol only signals high quality when volatile acidity is low. This interaction explicitly models that synergetic effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fermentation efficiency: `alcohol_density_ratio = alcohol / density`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* Grouped means showed density decreases while alcohol increases with quality — ratio captures fermentation completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sulphate–citric interaction: `sulphates * citric_acid` or `citric_acid / sulphates`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* EDA suggested sulphates and citric acid jointly correlate with perceived freshness and preservation. Create both multiplicative and ratio variants and validate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementation notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When adding ratios, add a tiny `eps` (e.g., 1e-6).\n",
    "* Scale these engineered features after creation (same scaler as raw numeric features).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Model selection & evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evidence behind the recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Nonlinear interactions discovered in trivariate analysis (alcohol × VA etc.) → simple linear separability is limited.\n",
    "* Target class imbalance (Medium dominates) --> need balanced metrics/strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended pipeline \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create engineered features above.\n",
    "   * Log-transform skewed columns.\n",
    "   * Handle outliers.\n",
    "   * Scale numeric features (StandardScaler or RobustScaler).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Train/test split**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use **stratified** split on the classification label (quality or quality_label) to preserve class distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Baseline classifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Logistic Regression (multinomial)** or **LinearSVC**, to get interpretable baseline and coefficients for feature effect direction.\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* fast, interpretable baseline against which to measure non-linear gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Primary models**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Random Forest Classifier** — robust, captures interactions, insensitive to scaling and moderate outliers.\n",
    "   * **XGBoost / LightGBM** — usually gives best structured-data performance and handles non-linearity and feature interactions automatically.\n",
    "   * *Rationale:* EDA showed interactions and nonlinear relationships; tree ensembles are ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **If you want probability calibration** (for business decision thresholds), use **CalibratedClassifierCV** or isotonic regression on tree outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Class imbalance handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If using grouped three-class (`Low/Medium/High`) and Medium dominates:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * Use **class_weight='balanced'** for Logistic/Tree, or\n",
    "     * Use **resampling** (SMOTE for minority oversampling or undersampling majority) only **within CV (cross validation)** to avoid leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Use **StratifiedKFold** (k=5 or 10) for reliable multiclass estimates.\n",
    "   * Use grid/random search with metric = **macro-F1** or **balanced accuracy** to prioritize performance across classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Evaluation metrics**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Primary:** macro-F1 (balances class-wise performance) or balanced accuracy.\n",
    "   * **Secondary:** Confusion matrix to see which quality classes are confused. ROC-AUC per class can be used (one-vs-rest).\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Explainability**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * For final model, run **feature importance** (trees) and **SHAP** values to verify engineered acidity ratios and interactions actually contribute.\n",

    "## 6. **Production-oriented suggestions**\n",
    " *strictly based on dataset patterns only*\n",
    "\n",
    "> I am *not* presuming domain expertise beyond the dataset; these are suggestions that follow from what the data shows. For real world production changes please consult an oenologist.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Focus on achieving higher alcohol (within acceptable taste ranges)** — dataset shows mean alcohol is ~9.96 at quality 3 and ~12.09 at quality 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Why:* Higher alcohol strongly correlates with higher quality in this dataset (+0.48).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimize volatile acidity (VA)** — mean VA drops 0.88 → 0.42 as quality rises.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Why:* VA has the second-strongest correlation (−0.39) and EDA visuals show lower VA in high-quality wines.\n",
    "   * *Actionable:* Monitor fermentation to avoid acetic fermentation; keep VA below identified good-range in data (approx ≤0.4).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Aim for balanced fixed-to-volatile acidity ratio** (engineer and track this ratio).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Why:* EDA showed that balance (not just absolute fixed acid) correlates with higher quality. Ratio is a concise production metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Moderate sulphates** — slightly higher sulphates associate with higher quality (but not linearly).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Why:* Sulphates correlate positively (+0.25) and grouped means rise; use moderate, not excessive addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Encourage complete fermentation** (reduce density while maintaining alcohol).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * *Why:* Density decreased while alcohol increased among higher-quality samples. Incomplete fermentation leaves residual sugar (= higher density) and tends to be lower quality.\n",
