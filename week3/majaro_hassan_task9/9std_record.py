''' Task 4: Student Record
    Create an empty dictionary called student
    Ask the user to input their name and age, then store them in the dictionary
    Add a list of scores (e.g., [70, 85, 90]) to the dictionary.
    Use a comparison operator to check if the student has passed (average score >= 50). Save the result (True/False) in the dictionary under the key "passed".
    Use a logical operator to check if the student is a teenager (age between 13 and 19). Save the result as "teenager".
    Print out the complete record in this format:
        Student Record:
            Name: John
            Age: 16
            Scores: [70, 85, 90]
            Passed: True
            Teenager: True
